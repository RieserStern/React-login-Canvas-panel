## React Canvas Demo
This is a React.js application demo for a instructional blog on Medium that walks through the process of 
adding an interactive HTML5 canvas element into a React.js component. The app also demonstrates
how to synchronize the data in the canvas element with state using a custom useCanvas hook.
